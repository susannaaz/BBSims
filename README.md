# BBSims

Library to produce map-based simulations with input experiment configuration
compatible with Simons Observatory (LiteBIRD is being added).

The outputs are directly compatible with the inputs to [BBPipe](https://github.com/simonsobs/BBPipe),
its submodule [BBPower](https://github.com/simonsobs/BBPower),
and [BBHybrid](https://github.com/susannaaz/BBHybrid).

Used to produce simulations for:
1. [A minimal power-spectrum-based moment expansion for CMB B-mode searches](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2021/05/047/meta)
2. [A hybrid map-Cℓ component separation method for primordial CMB B-mode searches](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2023/03/035)
